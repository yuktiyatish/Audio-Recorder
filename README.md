# Audio-Recorder
Prototype for Audio Recording App

The audio can then be uploaded to and ordered for transcription on Scribie(an online audio/video transcription service)
which has exposed a REST based API for the same. 
The user who has a specific API key generated can then see all the uploaded files in his account.
All the action that a user can perform from the website will be supported through this app in the coming iteration
